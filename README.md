## How It Works

1. **Content Generation**: The system generates a comprehensive JSON file using **Deepseek**, outlining the video's title, hook, caption, segments, dialogue, image prompts, transitions, and other metadata.
2. **Image Creation**: **Flux** generates visually compelling images based on the prompts specified in the JSON file.
3. **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: **TTSMP3** converts the dialogue into high-quality audio files for narration.
4. **Video Assembly**: **FFmpeg** stitches together the generated images, audio, and transitions to produce the final video.
5. **Instagram Posting**: The program automatically uploads the completed video to Instagram, complete with captions and hashtags.
