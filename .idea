The purpose is to automate the process of content creation leveraging free AI services like Gemini(For Text and Audio) and Flux AI (For Images).

The program should do the following thing in steps to reach the desired goal of creating a content for social media.

1. The niche is to create content for the social media related to popular Animes, Manga, TV series, Coding, Technology or a Movie. The content would be structured as follows:
	a. Will pick any on from the given niche. Example: Anime.
	b. Will select any popular Anime. Example: One Piece.
	c. Now the content can be something like (
		1. Which devil fruit user are you based on your birth month?
		2. Which character are you based on first letter of your name?
		).
	   Come up with a content like such for each niche! The questions should be related to the niche. Come up with more unique questions using the AI, if required search the Web for more Context!.
	   After The Question show the Images with the choices/options for the users!
2. Generate Script for the short 30 second video content.
3. The Script should be very detailed, must have 5 to 6 points after the initial intro or description. The Script should be based on the niche.
4. Once the Script is generated, generate the prompts for the images that would go into the video, at a time there could be 7 images based on the generated points by the script.
5. Once the script and the images are generated, generate the Audio for the video.
7. Combine everything together using FFMPEG. Use the script as a subtitle. Depending on the Content the subtitle should be impactful or mild in style.
8. From the Script provide the Caption, tags and hashtags for the video.
